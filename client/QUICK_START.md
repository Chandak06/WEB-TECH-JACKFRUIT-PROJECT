## 🧭 Navigation Guide

### For Non-Authenticated Users:
- **Home** (`/`) → Landing page with features
- **Login** (`/login`) → Sign in page
- **Sign Up** (`/signup`) → Registration page

### For "Authenticated" Users:
(Authentication not implemented yet, but pages are accessible)
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) → Main hub after login
- **Browse** (`/browse`) → Find skills and mentors
- **Sessions** (`/sessions`) → View your sessions

## 🔄 User Flow Example

1. Start at Home (`/`) → Click "Get Started"
2. Sign Up (`/signup`) → Create account
3. Login (`/login`) → Sign in
4. Dashboard (`/dashboard`) → See your stats
5. Browse (`/browse`) → Find a skill to learn
6. Click "Book Session" → Schedule with mentor
7. Sessions (`/sessions`) → View upcoming session

## 📊 Mock Data

All pages currently use **mock data** (hardcoded):
- Sample users (Sarah Johnson, Michael Brown, etc.)
- Sample skills (React, Python, UI/UX, etc.)
- Sample sessions (dates, times, statuses)

This is **perfect for testing** the UI without needing a backend!

## 🎯 What Still Needs to be Built

### High Priority Pages:
1. **Profile Page** (`/profile/:id`) - View/edit user profiles
2. **Messages** (`/messages`) - Chat with mentors
3. **Settings** (`/settings`) - Account settings

### Features to Add:
- Authentication Context (manage login state)
- Protected Routes (redirect if not logged in)
- API Integration (connect to backend)
- Real-time messaging
- Video call integration
- Payment processing

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Real Authentication**: Login/Signup don't actually authenticate
2. **Mock Data**: All data is hardcoded, not from API
3. **No Persistence**: Data resets on page refresh
4. **Social Login**: Buttons are UI only, no OAuth
5. **No Backend**: Purely frontend application

## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Navigate freely** - All routes work without auth
2. **Try the search** on Browse page
3. **Switch tabs** on Sessions page
4. **Toggle between Skills/Mentors** on Browse page
5. **Check responsive design** - Resize browser window
6. **Test mobile menu** - Shrink to mobile size

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

Want to make changes? Here's how:

### Change Colors:
Look for gradient classes:
```jsx
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-600 to-purple-600"
```

### Add Mock Data:
Edit the arrays in each component:
```javascript
const skills = [
  { name: 'Your Skill', category: 'Category', ... }
]
```

### Modify Layout:
All pages follow the same structure:
1. Navbar
2. Background gradients
3. Content wrapper
4. Grid layouts
